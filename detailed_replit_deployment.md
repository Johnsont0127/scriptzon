## 3. Uploading the Scriptli Files

### Option 1: Using the Provided ZIP File (Recommended)

### Option 2: Manual File Creation (Alternative)

If you prefer to set up the files manually or are having issues with the ZIP file:

## 4. Setting Up MongoDB Atlas

MongoDB Atlas is a cloud database service that we'll use to store all application data.

   - Click "Add endpoint"
   - For the endpoint URL, you'll need your Replit URL + "/payments/webhook"
     (You'll get your Replit URL after running the app for the first time, so you may need to come back to this step)

   | Key | Value | Description |
   |-----|-------|-------------|
   | `PORT` | `3000` | The port your application will run on |
   | `MONGODB_URI` | Your MongoDB connection string | From MongoDB Atlas setup |
   | `SESSION_SECRET` | A random string | For securing sessions (e.g., `scriptli_session_secret_123`) |
   | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Your OpenAI API key | From OpenAI setup |
   | `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Your Stripe publishable key | From Stripe setup |
   | `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Your Stripe secret key | From Stripe setup |
   | `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Your Stripe webhook secret | From Stripe webhook setup |

   | `BASE_URL` | Your Replit URL | Will be available after first run (e.g., `https://scriptli.yourusername.repl.co`) |

   Note: For the `BASE_URL`, you'll need to run the application first to get your Replit URL, then come back and add this secret.

## 9. Running the Application

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - In the Replit shell (bottom panel), run:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - This will install all the required packages defined in package.json
   - Wait for the installation to complete (this may take a few minutes)

2. **Start the Application**:
   - Click the "Run" button at the top of the Replit interface
   - Alternatively, in the shell, run:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - You should see output indicating that the server has started

3. **Get Your Replit URL**:
   - Once the application is running, you'll see a browser window open in the right panel
   - The URL in this browser is your Replit URL (e.g., `https://scriptli.yourusername.repl.co`)
   - Copy this URL and add it as the `BASE_URL` environment variable in Secrets
   - Also update your Stripe webhook endpoint with this URL + "/payments/webhook"

## 10. Testing Your Application

1. **Test User Registration**:
   - Visit your Replit URL in a browser
   - Click "Sign Up" or "Get Started"
   - Create a test account

2. **Test Script Generation**:
   - After logging in, go to the dashboard
   - Click "Create New Script"
   - Fill in the product details and generate a script
   - Verify that the script is generated correctly

3. **Test Subscription (Using Stripe Test Cards)**:
   - Go to the pricing page
   - Select a subscription plan
   - Use Stripe test card numbers for payment:
     - Test successful payment: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
     - Test card decline: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
     - Expiration date: Any future date
     - CVC: Any 3 digits
     - ZIP: Any 5 digits

4. **Test Affiliate System**:
   - Go to your account page
   - Find the "Refer a Friend" section
   - Copy your referral link
   - Open an incognito/private browser window
   - Paste the referral link and sign up as a new user
   - Verify that the referral is tracked correctly

## 11. Connecting a Custom Domain

If you want to use your own domain instead of the Replit URL:

1. **Purchase a Domain** (if you don't already have one):
   - Use a domain registrar like Namecheap, GoDaddy, or Google Domains

2. **Connect Domain to Replit**:
   - In your Replit project, click on the webview (browser preview)
   - Click the settings icon (gear) in the top-right corner
   - Select "Custom domains"
   - Click "Add a custom domain"
   - Enter your domain name and follow the instructions
   - You'll need to add DNS records at your domain registrar:
     - Type: `CNAME`
     - Name: `www` or `@` (for root domain)
     - Value: Your Replit URL (without https://)
     - TTL: 3600 or default

3. **Update Environment Variables**:
   - Once your domain is connected, update the `BASE_URL` environment variable to use your custom domain
   - Also update your Stripe webhook endpoint with your custom domain
